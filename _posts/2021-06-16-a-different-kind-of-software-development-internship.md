I started working with OnePageCRM in May 2020 as a Software Development intern. It has been an overwhelmingly positive experience with ample amounts of opportunities, self-development, and learning.

I was first introduced to the world of Customer Relationship Management when I had applied for an internship with a financial institution and by chance worked on analytics in this area. The variety of platforms and services used to optimize CRM in the business fascinated me. Early on, I saw the vital importance of and actual results produced by CRM systems when done right.

### Joining OnePageCRM

After some research I was surprised to see there was a company that was making waves in the industry in my university town: OnePageCRM. Despite there being no open positions at the time, I sent in a CV on the off chance there might be an opportunity available with them for a junior position, and I was overjoyed to discover they were interested in speaking with me. After interviewing and learning more about the company, I knew it was going to be a great fit in terms of culture and learning opportunities.
<br/><br/>

When planning for the summer, back in January 2020, my team lead and I envisioned a traditional, in-house kind of an internship. We didn’t factor an international pandemic into our plan. Fortunately, the OnePageCRM’s team has been working from all over the world long before the pandemic. So joining the company in a remote capacity was easier than I could have expected.

### Projects and Experiences 

My main focus during my initial internship was on working on an integration of the Twilio API. The project was destined to become far more complex than predicted. During it, I gained valuable experience in the proper integration of a 3rd-party service into a full-stack web application and upped my development skills in Ruby-on-Rails, one of the world’s foremost web application stacks.  Experiencing web development in a professional environment has proven invaluable and, as I continued working on the project, I became much more confident in my ability to take on more intricate work.


OnePageCRM supported me through the whole project. They helped establish clear priorities, ensured I stayed motivated, and provided me with mentoring and support from a professional software engineer as well as a project manager. I felt like a real part of the team, participated in daily standups and meetings, and joined the company's team events. I was excited to see where the company could take my career in the future. So I was delighted to be offered a second opportunity with them as a Junior Developer until August 2021 after which I would return to the university to finish the remainder of my degree.

My second placement with them has been rewarding in ways I could have never imagined. I’ve worked on various smaller security projects as well as an integration of a new important security measure that will be a welcome addition for many users. There are a few more interesting projects in the pipeline which I’ll get to be a part of. They will allow me to take the skills I’ve gained during my time here and take them to the next level.

I’ve gotten unmatched levels of support and motivation from the company, and it has helped me achieve goals I never imagined possible. There is no better feeling for a junior developer than seeing a pull request in which their code becomes part of a real living code base and has an impact on thousands of people across the globe.

OnePageCRM’s ability to bring out the best in junior developers rivals, perhaps even exceeds, that of the technical giants, and I’m proud to have been allowed to grow and develop my skills in this company.  Even at this junior level, I feel invested in the growth of OnePageCRM and have been very lucky to be a part of it.
