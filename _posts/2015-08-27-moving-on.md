Today is my last day working at OnePageCRM and this will be my last post on the developer blog.

It's been a real pleasure working with everybody; the development team, product owners and our fantastic customer success team.
There is a great bunch of people working for OnePageCRM, both here in the Galway office and distributed around the world.

One of my main areas of responsibility at OnePageCRM was our [developer portal][1].
I have really enjoyed working with external developers - it has been brilliant to see how people use our API to develop integrations between their apps and OnePageCRM.

While I have been the main point of contact for many of our external partners, the rest of my team will be more than happy to answer any questions. Keep an eye out for Liam, Dan, John, Pawel, Cillian and Ana on the [developer forum][2].

I learned a lot at OnePageCRM, but one of the most important things I will bring away is our 'Get Things Done' methodology.
The 'Next Action' concept can be applied to any project and I hope to continue using this kind of thinking in my life after OnePageCRM.

So, what's my own Next Action? A slight change of direction and a return to university.
