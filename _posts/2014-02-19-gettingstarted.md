<p>If you are looking at this page you’re hopefully thinking about developing a cool plugin or service for OnePageCRM using our API access.  Check out our documentation and spread the OnePage love and eco-system.</p>
<p>OnePage uses a RESTful API with XML, JSON or YAML over HTTP.</p>
<p>We’re continuously improving and updating our app and the API. Check out Version History for recently applied updates.</p>
<h3>What kind of really useful stuff can I build?</h3>
