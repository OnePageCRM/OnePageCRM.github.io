<p>
  The optional <code class="bluetext">fields</code> parameter is a powerful tool allowing you to requested related resources to the main resource which you are fetching
  
  <h3 id="fetching-associated-resources" class="top-padding">Fetching Associated Resources</h3>
  <p>If you want to receive associated resources in addition to a default fieldset, you can use eith the resource name with all, or empty - both defailt to sending all fields for the sub resource <span class="bluetext">deals(all)</span> or <span class="bluetext">deals()</span>. The following request would return all default contact fields plus linked deals:</p>

  <p class="url"><code class="bluetext"><span class="get-text">GET</span> contacts.json?fields=deals()</code></p>

  <p> Or you could request multiple resources with contacts: </p>  
  <p class="url"><code class="bluetext"><span class="get-text">GET</span> contacts.json?fields=deals(),calls(),notes()</code></p>
