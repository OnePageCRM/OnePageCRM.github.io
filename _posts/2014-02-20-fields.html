<h2>Fields Parameter</h2>
<p>By default, all <span class="get-text">GET</span> requests return all <a href="#resource-fields">resource fields.</a><br/>
  Optional <code class="bluetext">fields</code> parameter is a powerful tool allowing you to do a handful of things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Work with only the data you need.</li>
    <li>Request complementary data for resources like total pending amount for contacts.</li>
    <li>Request associated resources in the same request. For example, to include linked deals when getting contacts.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="basic-use">Basic Use</h3>
  <p><code class="bluetext">fields</code> is a comma-separated list of field names you want returned.</p>
  <p><code class="bluetext">id</code> field, which identifies individual resources like contacts, is always returned for <span class="get-text">GET</span> requests, so there is no point in specifying it unless it is the only field you want returned.</p>
  <p>For example, to get contacts with only IDs, first names and last names, you would use a following request:</p>
  <p class="url"><code class="bluetext"><span class="get-text">GET</span> contacts.json?fields=first_name,last_name</code></p>

  <h3 id="field-types">Field Types</h3>
  <p>There are three types of fields in our API:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong id="resource-fields">Resource fields</strong> - These fields make up a resource, comprising its default fieldset. When you <span class="put-text">PUT</span> or <span class="post-text">POST</span> to a resource, only these fields are handled, all others are ignored.</li>
    <li><strong>Complementary data</strong> - These fields can be added for <span class="get-text">GET</span> requests, providing some additional data for convenience. For example, Contacts resource has a <code class="bluetext">photo_url</code> complementary field providing the url of the contact's photo. If provided in <span class="put-text">PUT</span> or <span class="post-text">POST</span> requests - these fields are ignored.</li>
    <li><strong>Associated resources</strong> - These fields allow you to get resources that are linked to the resource you are fetching, in the same request. For example, if you fetch a contact, you can request to add its deals to the response. See the <a href="#fetching-associated-resources">section</a> below for more info on associated resources.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>On each resource’s page, you can see a list of its main fields, as well as available complementary data and associated resources.</p>
  
  <h3 id="fetching-associated-resources">Fetching Associated Resources</h3>
  <p>In every resource’s section you can see a list of associated resources. For example, contacts can have actions, deals and notes associated with them. To grab those in the same request, just specify them as a field.<br/>If you are familiar with SQL, this is similar to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(SQL)#Left_outer_join">Left Outer Join</a> operation.</p>
  <p>So if you’d like to add deals to our basic example above, just use:</p>
  <p class="url"><code class="bluetext"><span class="get-text">GET</span> contacts.json?fields=first_name,last_name,deals</code></p>
  
  <h4 id="all-shortcut"><span class="bluetext" style="display:inline">all</span> shortcut</h4>
  <p>If you want to receive associated resources in addition to a full default fieldset, you can use <span class="bluetext">all</span> shortcut which is the same thing as listing all default fields. The following request would return all default contact fields plus linked deals:</p>
  <p class="url"><code class="bluetext"><span class="get-text">GET</span> contacts.json?fields=all,deals</code></p>
  
  <h4 id="specifying-fields-for-associated-resources">Specifying fields for associated resources</h4>
  <p>Going further, you can specify which fields you want returned for associated resources. To limit deals’ data in previous example to only the fields you need, just list them in parentheses:</p>
  <p class="url"><code class="bluetext"><span class="get-text">GET</span> contacts.json?fields=all,deals(name,amount)</code></p>
  
  <h4 id="chaining">Chaining</h4>
  <p>Going even further than that, you can expand the fieldset for these associated resources, requesting resources that are linked down the chain.</p>
  <p>For example, if you want to request a list of actions (actions stream) with contacts, plus deals and notes linked to those contacts, this is how you would do it:</p>
  <p class="url"><code class="bluetext"><span class="get-text">GET</span> actions.json?fields=all,contacts(all,deals,notes)</code></p>
  <p>And of course you can tweak fieldsets for all of those linked resources:</p>
  <p class="url"><code class="bluetext"><span class="get-text">GET</span> actions.json?fields=all,contacts(all,deals(name,amount),notes(text))</code></p>
  <p class="url"><code class="bluetext"><span class="get-text">GET</span> contacts.json?fields=notes(text),deals(name,amount),actions(all)</code></p>
