In our today job we are using various kinds of APIs in the different way:
by writing clients for them, creating & updating our own or simply
using some without even knowing about that. But have you ever wondered what actually
API is, what stays behind that acronym, how to properly build, utilize it and
making our life easier with them? Because we have asked those questions to
ourselves, did some research in the subject and decided to share the knowledge
about it.

Last night we have meet in [McSwiggans Pub & Restaurant][1] for the second 
[Galway Developer Meetup][2] where we had 4 speaks about following subjects:
