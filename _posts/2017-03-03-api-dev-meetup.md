Working in a SaaS company, we regularly deal with and come across APIs.
Examples here would include; writing clients for them, creating & updating
our own API or even in some cases, using other ones without even knowing
about them.

Have you ever wondered what actually API is? What says behind the acronym,
how to properly build, utilize it and making our life easier with them?
Because we have asked those questions of ourselves, carried out
some research in the subject and decided to share this knowledge.

Recently, we hosted a Developer Event in [McSwiggans Pub & Restaurant][1]
in our home of [Galway][Galway]. This was the second [Galway Developer Meetup][2]
where we covered the API topic in some detail.

We had 4 spearkers on the night covering the following:

* **Introduction to API**: Liam introduced us to the magic world of API
  including some of the key terms and definitions used...
* **Creating a sample REST web API**: Paweł demonstrated how to use
  [Amazon Web Services][3] to create sample REST web API.
* **Using Android to Call from a RESTful API**: Cillian presented how to
  utilize sample API by creating simple [Spotify][4] player for Android platform.
* **In-app purchase APIs**: Finn Krewer from [9th Impact][5] game development
  company shared his knowledge about purchase APIs across various mobile platforms.

Our meetup was a great success and we’ve received so much positive feedback from
attendees. Thanks to [OnePageCRM][8] for sponsoring the event and Finn
from [9th Impact][5] for taking the time to present and speak with our attendees after.

We hope that all of you have great time during the meetup either by listening
to our talks or by sharing some knowledge at the end.

meeting(s), and/or you want to share your knowledge as well, feel free to
