OnePageCRM is delighted to announce that we are supporting the upcoming <a href="http://codeninja.ie" target="_blank">CodeNinja</a> competition. 

CodeNinja is an app / game development competition, designed to train and encourage students to be creative in the cultivation of their own tech ideas.

This will be the competition's third year, having been run in 2011/2012 and 2013/2014 for NUI Galway and GMIT students. The competition is open to students of all disciplines, either individuals or groups, who want to build a web or mobile app / game.

The project aims to foster students' creativity, teach them new skills, build relationships with technology entrepeneurs and academic experts, and ultimately cultivate their ideas, while adding to their portfolio and CV in the process.

Local industry partners such as <a href="https://www.onepagecrm.com" target="_blank">OnePageCRM</a>, <a href="https://www.exordo.com" target="_blank">Ex Ordo</a>, <a href="https://educatedmachine.com" target="_blank">Educated Machine</a>, <a href="http://9thimpact.com" target="_blank">9th Impact</a> and <a href="http://launchpadnuig.com" target="_blank">Blackstone LaunchPad, NUI Galway</a> support the initiative, as it is an opportunity which sows a seed to build on the blossoming tech start up culture that exists in Galway whilst nurturing relationships with NUI Galway, GMIT and the Galway tech community.

The first <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1573550432705535" target="_blank">event</a> took place in the Hardiman Research Building, NUI Galway on Novemeber 8, where a group of ambitions students were briefed on the layout and timeline of the competition and given an informative presentation on developing your idea by Blackstone Launchpad's Executive Director for NUI Galway, Natalie Walsh.

A second <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1547890105290234" target="_blank">event</a>, detailing the tools and learning platforms students should use to aid them in managing and developing their projects, is due to take place on November 15 at the same location. This session will be delivered by Miche√°l Reilly of Educated Machine.

Following the break for the Christmas period, the competition will reconvene with a number of technology demos from industry partners, where students can get an idea of the type of the projects they could be expected to produce if they are looking to win! More on this at a later date.

The submission deadline for the competition is not until 1pm on Monday, March 12. So if you miss any of the sessions, don't worry - you can still enter before that date as long as you're a student of NUI Galway or GMIT (though we would recommend that students take full advantage of the resources at their disposal).
