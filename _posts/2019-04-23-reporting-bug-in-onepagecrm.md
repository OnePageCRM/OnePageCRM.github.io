#### Bug Bounty Program

With over 10,000 users worldwide using OnePageCRM it’s our responsibility to keep their data safe and secure. We’re pleased to announce details of our Bug Bounty Program - to encourage anyone who finds any vulnerabilities in the OnePageCRM app to report it and be rewarded! 

Every bug will vary therefore we advise anyone who discovers a security bug to provide us with a detailed report and email our team at support@onepagecrm.com

Tips for Reporting bugs:
* Be as descriptive as possible 
* Be clear
* State the facts
* Describe what you expected to happen
* Describe what actually happened
* List of steps to reproduce the bug
* Add any screenshots if possible

Our dedicated security team will investigate your report and respond to you as soon as possible. Security researchers or those who report vulnerabilities on the OnePageCRM app and who adhere to the Bug Bounty Policy will receive a monetary reward or “bounty.” 

We appreciate the time and effort invested by you in our mission to make our products and services free of security flaws and the risks associated with them.
See here for more details on the program.
