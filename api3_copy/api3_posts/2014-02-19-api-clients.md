We have a number of API Clients available to help you quickly get started:

* Web [API Browser](api_browser). The API Browser is currently limited to `GET` requests. Built in Angular.js and code available on [Github][3]
* Python Client available on [Pypi][1] and [Github][2]
* Basic Ruby Client available on [Rubygems][4] [Github][5]
* PHP authentication script on [Github][6]
* Java Client on [Github][7]
* PHP Client (work in progress) on [Packagist][8]

You can sign into these clients with your existing OnePageCRM account.
