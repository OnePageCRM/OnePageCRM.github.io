## Application ##

This JavaScript application is intended to make development and testing of the
API easier.

## Usage ##

Open the file in your browser. Log into your development system. Start making
API requests

## Build ##

Clone the repository and it should hopefully allow you to make requests.
If it doesn't install lighttpd, apache, nginx or your favourite web server and
host it statically on that. Then both will be on localhost and there shouldn't
be any problems connecting one to the other
